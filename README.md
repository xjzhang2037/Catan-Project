The project was last updated in December 2012.

About:
This project was the result of a Team Software Project class
at Michigan Technological University.
Graphics was rendered in AWT and all server / clients are written
in Java.

Notes:
I think a lot of the algorithms we used back then were not as efficient
as it could have been. But for a 3 month project and mostly new
I think the project is pretty good.

Bugs:
 - Second settlement does not grant resources upon setup.
		Not really a bug, whereas we forgot that was part
		of the rules.
